# About Come Out and Dance

Come Out and Dance (COAD) is an online calendar of weekly and monthly social dance venues. Its raison d'etre is help people find social dancing _anywhere_ (eventually).

The focus is social partner or group dancing. Swing, Ballroom, Latin, Folk, Line, Country, and other social dances are welcome to be listed here. If it is a regularly occurring venue that involves people dancing in pairs or groups to a style with defined footwork and rhythm, it is welcome here. Sorry, but club dancing venues will not be listed on here, even if they are well suited to be "Dance Bombed."

Right now, COAD is a relatively small list of venues and links to their websites for further information. Stay tuned as this site evolves to better aid dancers everywhere. Also, the venues are mainly for Lindy Hop, West Coast Swing, and Blues around the San Francisco Bay Area because that it what Matt is familiar with, but with help it will grow to encompass all social dances in all areas. If you would like to add a venue to the list, <a href="/add-venue/">fill out the form</a>.

The calendar on COAD will _always_ be free to view and to be listed on. Future features on this website may cost money and/or be funded by ads, but such choices will be carefully weighed.
